FV-1 Testing Programs

Bank A

Programs 0-4 check immediate loading and ACC to DAC correspondence
Programs 5-7 check some initial conditions

Program 0: Output 0
	- write 0x000000 to DACL
	- what does DAC output when 0 is written?
	PASS: DAC 0 output is 1.662V

Program 1: Output Max
	- write 0x7fffff to DACL
	- what does DAC output when a maximum value is written?
	PASS: DAC max output is 3.035V

Program 2: Output Min
	- write 0x800000 to DACL
	- what does DAC output when a minimum value is written?
	PASS: DAC min output is 0.289V

Program 3: ACC->REG->ACC
	- copy immediate values between ACC and REG and compare
	- are 24 bit values preserved on copy in and out of REG?
	PASS: 24bit values copy in and out of reg

Program 4: ACC Range Check
	- output sawtooth wave using full ACC width
	- how does ACC handle minimum changes at output?
	PASS: output rises steadily and matches expected waveform

Program 5: PACC initial value
	- store PACC then output stored value
	- what value does PACC hold on program load?
	PASS: PACC is initialised with 0

Program 6: ACC initial value
	- store ACC then output stored value
	- also store ADCL into delay for next test
	- what value does ACC hold on program load?
	PASS: ACC is initialised with 0

Program 7: delay ram initial content
	- write out delay ram
	- what values are in delay ram on program load?
	PASS: delay ram is initialised with 0
